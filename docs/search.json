We start by introducing version control and exploring how it can be beneficial to researchers, then we introduce some useful tools and get started with some basic workflow using these tools. We build on those foundations with collaborative exercises that introduce key concepts such as forks, pull requests and branches and give you the chance to get some hands-on experience with using version control in a research setting."

The core idea around the course is that by improving your understanding of working with branches and how to make your commits tidier and neater it makes it easier to understand pull requests and Git history which in turn makes it easier to collaborate and work on code with others (including your future self!)."

This course on Code Design introduces essential principles and best practices for writing clean and maintainable code. We will learn how we can write clean code, adhering to naming conventions, commenting, and following PEP 8 guidelines. We will then explore some fundamental principles such as DRY, KISS or YAGNI that are important to keep in mind when writing new code and see how we can spend less time touching the code by introducing configuration files and command line interface."

    "text": "Code Testing\n\n\n Who: Sylvia Whittle\nWhen/Length: January (half day)\nFormat: In person\n\n\n Abstract:\nDoes your code work? Are you sure? How do you ensure that it keeps working when you change it? Manually verifying is slow and tedious. Why not automate it? Software testing checks that your code works for you, and when it breaks, it can show you exactly where it broke, without you having to trawl through hundreds of lines of code manually.This course aims to provide you with the tools you need to start automatically ensuring the reliability of your code."

This course will provide you with an overview of different ways to make your code reproducible and then focus on virtual environments as a specific tool for computational reproducibility."

This is an ideal way to get recognition (and citation) for the software you have spent countless hours creating. In this course we will walk you through an example of submission in the Journal of open Source software. We will make an example software submission to the journal, and thanks to the collaboration of the Editor in Chief of JOSS (Arfon Smith), we will look at how the review process is done."
