# Why OPEN?


## Research is a continuous process

## Research creates knowledge…that is passed down{.smaller}

`"Knowledge is humankind's most precious treasure. Everything that we accomplished has been done due to the capacity to create a transmissible heritage, which spares each new generation the task of starting from scratch."` B. Sirbey<br><br><br>

> If we are doing the research you are doing today, it is thanks to the work of previous generations that created the knowledge that we are using know.

## And that can be trusted...

::: {.columns}

-   Research relies on the ability to trust what has been done before. 
-   This means that a result has been tested, verified and could be `reproduced` :arrow_right::arrow_right:

A guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings<br><font size="4"> –Wilkinson et al. (2016)–  </font>
:::

:::

## The FAIR principles

“Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, `specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning` — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles.”

<font size="4">[Chue Hong, Neil P. et al, FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles)](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068)</font>


## Findable {.smaller}

**Software, and its associated metadata, is easy for both humans and machines to find.**

<font size=6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Components of the software representing levels of granularity are assigned distinct identifiers.</li>
        <li>Different versions of the software are assigned distinct identifiers.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Software is described with rich metadata.</li>
<li>Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the software they describe.</li>
<li>Metadata are FAIR, searchable and indexable.</li>
</ol>
</font>

<font size=4>[Barker *et al.* *Scientific Data* 9:622 (2022) "Introducing the FAIR Principles for research software" DOI: 10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)</font>


## Accessible 

**Software, and its metadata, is retrievable via standardised protocols.**

<font size=6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software is retrievable by its identifier using a standardised communications protocol.
    <ol type="i">
        <li>The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.</li>
        <li>The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Metadata are accessible, even when the software is no longer available.</li>
</ol>
</font>

<font size=4>[Barker *et al.* *Scientific Data* 9:622 (2022) "Introducing the FAIR Principles for research software" DOI: 10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)</font>

## Interoperable

**Software interoperates with other software by exchanging data and/or metadata, and/or through interaction via application programming interfaces (APIs), described through standards.**

<font size=6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software reads, writes and exchanges data in a way that meets domain-relevant community standards.</li>
<li>Software includes qualified references to other objects.</li>
</ol>
</font>

<font size=4>[Barker *et al.* *Scientific Data* 9:622 (2022) "Introducing the FAIR Principles for research software" DOI: 10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)</font>

## Reusable

**Software is both usable (can be executed) and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software).**

<font size=6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software is described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Software is given a clear and accessible license.</li>
        <li>Software is associated with detailed provenance.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Software includes qualified references to other software.</li>
<li>Software meets domain-relevant community standards.</li>
</ol>

## University's position about FAIR {.smaller}

<br>
‘‘We aspire to open research culture that values a diverse range of contributions and adheres to the FAIR principles to enable the results of our research to be of maximum benefit to society (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), whilst also respecting circumstances that limit data sharing (for example, due to issues of privacy, non-consent, contractual agreements, legislation or practicality).’’  
[University of Sheffield, Statement on Open Research](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/openresearch/university-statement-open-research)
<br><br>
‘‘All researchers, including postgraduate research students, have a personal responsibility to manage effectively the data they create….. All researchers are expected to document research data and software in line with the FAIR principles…..’’
